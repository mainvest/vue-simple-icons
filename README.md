See all icons and usage here: https://vue-simple-icons.mainvest.com

### Sizing

By default, icons will be sized based on the font size of the parent element.

You can set a custom size using the `size` attribute.
For multiple based sizing, pass the desired multiple followed by an `x`.

```html
<facebook-icon size="1.5x" class="custom-class"></facebook-icon>
```

You can also set a `px` size directly by passing an integer

```html
<facebook-icon size="25" class="custom-class"></facebook-icon>
```

## Note
* Because [identifiers canâ€™t start with numeric literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Identifier_after_number), names beginning with numbers have them converted to English words. For example, the logo for 500px is available as `FiveHundredPxIcon`.
* Versioning follows the [Simple Icons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons) package.
